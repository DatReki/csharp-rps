A quick rock paper scissor game I made for the heck of it

## Why?
I was bored and saw someone elses and decided to make my own

## How does it work?
Simply open it in your favorite IDE compile (or download a release) and play. There are no scores no objectives and it automatically restarts on every win, loss or whatever

Feel free to edit or do whatever with it.
